# Scrapper project using Cheerio & Puppeteer

Scrapping a website has been one of my favorite project, because the fun thing about this project is that how you can grab a particular website data with html, fetch it using axios and then using the data on your own api server.

Which you can use it however you like with the data like integration on your frontend, or exporting the data into csv for machine learning. but remember to also include the website origin when you fetch the data, because you don't own the data.

## How to install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyrhman/node-scrapper.git
cd node-scrapper
node <name of the file>
```
